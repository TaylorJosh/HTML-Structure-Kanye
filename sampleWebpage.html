<h1>Kanye's best song?</h1>

    <p>
        Kanye West is one of the most influential artists of my generation. Since his introduction as a producer, Kanye has changed the landscape of hip hop music. Below, I will make a case for <em>Jesus Walks</em> and <em>Runaway as Kanye’s</em> best songs. 
    </p>

<h2>Jesus Walks</h2>
    <p>
    This is arguably Kanye’s best song. Created in a sea of misogyny and violence, <i>“Jesus Walks”</i> was a shining light for a perpetually distasteful genre. Growing up as a hip hop fan and a devout Christian, it was hard to find a common ground. Kanye’s Jesus Walks not only filled that void, but also <del>encouraged</del> <strong>forced</strong> other popular hip hop artists to be more vulnerable about religious beliefs.
    </p>
<h3>Runaway</h3>
    <p>
    My beautiful dark twisted fantasy is Kanye’s best album, and the best song on the album is “Runaway.” Runaway shows a different side of Kanye. He was vulnerable and apologetic. The production was beyond anything that we had ever heard from Kanye, <strong><em><mark>and the accompanying video was theatrical.</mark></em></strong> As with most of Kanye’s material, Runaway and MBDTF changed hip hop artists and consumers.
